            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>
                We are students at McGill University, currently enrolled in the MAIS 202 Machine Learning Bootcamp. Our passion for applying machine learning to solve real-world problems inspired us to create HeartMap, a project designed to help individuals better understand their risk of heart disease. This initiative reflects our commitment to exploring how technology can empower individuals to make informed health decisions.

            <h2>Model and Dataset</h2>
            <p>
                HeartMap is built upon the Heart Disease Prediction Dataset sourced from Kaggle. This dataset contains labeled patient data, including vital health metrics such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. Our machine learning model, a Logistic Regression classifier, predicts the likelihood of heart disease using these features.

            <h2>Not a diagnosis</h2>
            <p>
                HeartMap is designed for educational purposes and is not a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis. The predictions generated by our model are based on statistical probabilities and should be interpreted as informative insights rather than definitive conclusions. For any health-related concerns, please consult a licensed healthcare professional.

            <p>
                We extend our heartfelt thanks to the instructors and TPMs of the MAIS 202 Bootcamp for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this project. We also acknowledge Kaggle for providing the Heart Disease Prediction Dataset and our peers for their collaboration and feedback, which played a vital role in shaping this project.
